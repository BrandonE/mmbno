============================
REQUIREMENTS
============================

* Python >= 2.4 (2.5 or 2.6 is recommended)

* pyglet >= 1.3.1 (http://pyglet.org/)

* Psyco >= 1.6 (Optional - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psyco/1.6)

* Twisted >= 8.2.0 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted/8.2.0)

The following are only needed if you wish to "compile" MMBNO into native
executable files:

* py2exe (Windows - http://www.py2exe.org/)

* py2app (Mac OS X - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2app/)


============================
INSTALL
============================

To run the game directly from the source code, just go:

    python mmbno.py

It's not much of an "install" utility, but it works. I do plan to get a
working NullSoft Install executable set-up for Windows someday. To install,
just run one of these commands in your system's command line:

Windows:
    python setup.py py2exe

Mac OS X:
    python setup.py py2app

============================
REPORT BUGS/FEATURE REQUESTS
============================

We all know that MMBN Online is far from perfect, and there is no real end to
such quirks; fortunately, they can be mitigated with cooperation. Should you 
find a bug, it can be reported (and you probably should, even if you're not
sure,) by submitting a support ticket and have it filed under "bugs".

If you think you have a good idea for a feature that is beneficial to the
program, then suggest it using that form as well.

WANT TO HELP?
============================

MMBNO is something that I do on my spare time, so I can't dedicate all the
time of my day toward it. If you have experience with programming in
Python, and know how to use the Pyglet library, then it would be great
if I could get a few helping hands to aid in mainstream development of
the program. If you are interested, then send me an email with some sort of
"sample of work" (written in Python, of course. :))

I can be contacted at:

THANK YOU
============================

Thank you for using MMBN Online. While it may not seem lik,
bug reports are actually huge contributions. Supplying patches is even better,
because issues are fixed much faster.

Enjoy,
Faltzer
