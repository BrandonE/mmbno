============================
REQUIREMENTS
============================

* Python >= 2.4 (2.5 or 2.6 is recommended)
* pyglet >= 1.3.1 (http://pyglet.org/)
* Psyco >= 1.6 (Optional - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psyco/1.6)
* Twisted >= 8.2.0 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted/8.2.0)
* json/simplejson

The following are only needed if you wish to "compile" MMBNO into OS native
executable files:

* py2exe (Windows - http://www.py2exe.org/)
* py2app (Mac OS X - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2app/)


============================
INSTALL
============================

To run the game directly from the source code, just go:

    python game.py

It's not much of an "install" utility, but it works. I do plan to get a
working NullSoft Install executable set-up for Windows someday. To install,
just run one of these commands in your system's command line:

Windows:
    python setup.py py2exe

Mac OS X:
    python setup.py py2app

REPORT BUGS/FEATURE REQUESTS
============================

We all know that MMBN Online is far from perfect, and there is no real end to
such quirks; fortunately, they can be mitigated with cooperation. Should you 
find a bug, it can be reported (and you probably should, even if you're not
sure,) by submitting a support ticket and have it filed under "bugs".

If you think you have a good idea for a feature that is beneficial to the
program, then suggest it using that form as well.

============================
WANT TO HELP?
============================

MMBNO is something that's done at our spare time, so we can't dedicate all the
time of day toward it. If you have experience with programming in
Python, and know how to o are willing to learn how to use the Pyglet library,
then it would be great to get a few helping hands to aid in mainstream
development of the program.

THANK YOU
============================

Thank you for using MMBN Online. While it may not seem like it,
bug reports are actually huge contributions.

Enjoy
